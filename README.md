# 28: Frontend routing

## Overview

SPA (Single Page Application) accomplished using React and React DOM Router.

#### Features

* Dashboard remains on screen as the sites UI
* create blog post (note)
* view blog post (notes)
* state is passed to App
* App distributes to needed components

### How To

##### Start react app and refresh actively

```
npm run watch
```

### Current State Of SPA

Currently, the structure is in place and props are being passed from CreationForm to App.

However, having issues getting state to pass back to list-creations. I think I am really close. 

Cheers to this post for helping me pass props to CreationForm using the React DOM Router:
